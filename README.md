# Crazyflie Monopod Perching
This repository contains a suite of code that allows the [Crazyflie quadcopter](https://www.bitcraze.io/products/crazyflie-2-1/) to perch on a monopod. It mainly consists of modifications to the [Crazyflie firmware and controller](https://github.com/bitcraze), as well as some additions to allow for data plotting to better understand the behaviour of the quadcopter.

The repository also includes code for controlling the quadcopter through a USB gamepad connected to the computer.
